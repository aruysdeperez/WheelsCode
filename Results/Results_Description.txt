In this folder are the lists of dictionaries that were processed by our workflow.

For two files whose filenames start the same, e.g. 'FiveFac_PREP_1.sage' and 'FiveFac_WIRE_WHEEL_6.sage':
The file ending in '...PREP_1.sage' contains a list of dictionaries that have yet to go through the workflow.
The file ending in '...WIRE_WHEEL_6.sage' contains the same list of dictionaries, having finished with the workflow.

When created, each dictionary has three entries describing the simplicial complex and its minimal code:

	'sc': a simplicial complex; NOTE that only the facets are listed
	'C': the neural code that is the minimal code of the particular simplicial complex in the dictionary
	'id': a unique name to identify that particular code and simplicial complex pair; NOTE that
	a code that belongs to both the pure codes and the codes with 3-7 maximal codewords has two different
	ids, based on which list it belongs to

There are also two Boolean entries, denoting the following properties:

	'solved': every intersection of facets of the simplicial complex is contained in the code
	'quasisolved': every intersection of facets, with the possible exception of the empty set [], is contained in the code

After going through the workflow, the following three Boolean entries are added to the dictionary: 

	'wheel': the code contains a wheel
	'indecomposable': the code is indecomposable
	'reduced': the code is reduced

The start of the file's name denotes what simplicial complexes the dictionaries of that file contain. 
-'ThreeFac' contains the simplicial complexes are those with three facets, 'FourFac' contains the 
simplicial complexes with four facets, etc.
-'Pure5D' contains the simplicial complexes that are pure of dimension 5, 'Pure4D' contains the
simplicial complexes that are pure of dimension 4, etc.
-For the pure simplicial complexes of dimension 2, since there are so many they are further broken down
by facet. Therefore 'Pure2D_3Fac' contains the simplicial complexes that are pure of dimension 2 
and have three facets, etc.
